## Task list

### Autoreload-gulp

This task will autoreload gulp on every change in the tasks files. It accept one parameter, the task name that you want to run with the flag -t or --task

i.e

If you want to run the dev task, you can do it typing this in the console:

	gulp autoreload-gulp -t dev

Or:

	gulp autoreload-gulp --task dev
